## Attribution
Thanks to `gitdagray` for initial skeleton for this project: https://github.com/gitdagray/nestjs-course. The graphql implementation was inspired by: https://github.com/vahid-nejad/nestjs-graphql-course.

## Description
The initial skeleton provides REST endpoints for doing CRUD operations on `users` which is an in memory list of users and their attributes.

### TODO:
- [ x ] Incorporate a GraphQL interface.
- [ x ] Implement a parent child relationship with an in-memor `posts` collection.
- [ x ] Implement a dataloader to optimize retrieval of user posts.

### Objectives Met
Access the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:3000/graphql

The graphql API can now satisfy the following queries:
```
# users corresponds to the name given to the "findAll" resolver
{users {id, name, email, role}}

# with posts
{users {id, name, email, role, posts {content}}}
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test
